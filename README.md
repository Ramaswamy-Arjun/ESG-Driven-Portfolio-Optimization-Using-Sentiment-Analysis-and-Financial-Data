# ESG-Driven-Portfolio-Optimization-Using-Sentiment-Analysis-and-Financial-Data

Investment strategies are heavily influenced by Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) factors, which are becoming essential measures for assessing business sustainability and moral behavior. ESG-driven portfolio optimization has become a potent instrument for coordinating financial performance with societal and environmental impact as the significance of sustainable development and responsible investment has grown. This research uses sentiment analysis, sophisticated financial modeling, and ESG data to develop a strong foundation for building portfolios that optimize profits while abiding by sustainability standards. Addressing the increasing need for investment methods that incorporate ESG factors and promote long-term wealth development is the main goal.
This project's integration of many datasets, such as sentiment analysis from market and media narratives, ESG scores, and financial performance measures, is one of its salient features. The study aims to find hidden patterns and correlations that improve portfolio optimization decision-making by combining these sources. In addition to ESG-specific indicators like environmental effect, social responsibility, and governance procedures, this entails calculating conventional financial metrics like risk and expected returns. Sentiment analysis is also used to measure investor and public perceptions, which adds another level of understanding to market dynamics and ESG trends.
The initiative builds ESG-driven portfolios for the Indian market and beyond using state-of-the-art computational methods, such as machine learning and optimization algorithms. ESG integration guarantees that the portfolios comply with international sustainability requirements, while Python, Alpha Vantage, and Quandl are utilized for data collecting and analysis. The ultimate objective is to develop a data-driven, scalable framework that illustrates the economic advantages of sustainable investing. Through ethical investment practices, this project helps to create a more egalitarian and environmentally friendly future by providing investors with practical information.
